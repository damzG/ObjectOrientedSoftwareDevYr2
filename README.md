  Precautions
Scenario 1: School PC has internet
Open VS Code on school PC.
Clone your school GitHub repo (first time only)
git clone https://github.com/damzG/ObjectOrientedSoftwareDevYr2.git his creates a copy of your repo locally on the school PC.
Work on the files.
After changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Work done at school"
git push

Back home, on your home PC:
git pull
This fetches the changes you made at school.

Scenario 2: School PC has no internet
In this case, you do need a copy of your repo (flash drive):
Copy your entire Desktop project folder including the .git folder to the flash drive.
Paste it on the school PC → work offline → commit changes locally.
When back home, copy changes to your Desktop folder (or pull later from GitHub if internet is available) → push.
